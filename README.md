Hello
I had an issue wtih the sqlite file reading into .py file so after troubleshooting with my professors I used a full path method and that worked. 

For my App: 
From the homepage you can click on the different path links to see the data. 
When doing a query for a specific date and finding the start date temperature, you will need to edit the URL to include the date where the 'start_date' appears. For finding the average over a date rang, you will need to edit the 'start_date' and 'end_date' in the URL for the time period you are looking at. 
All dates should be in the YYYY-MM-DD format and this is specififed on the homepage URL.
