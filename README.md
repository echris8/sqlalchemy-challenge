Hello
It seems there was an issue across the program getting the hawaii.sqlite file to read in from the Resources folder.
I discussed it with the professor and they said the issue was being reported across the program for some of the studnets with the same error. 
Because of this, I was unable to finish creating the App because the data woudl not load. I drafted the code based on in-class activities and tested ways of writing things here, but I could not test this one directly.
